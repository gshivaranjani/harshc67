Once upon a time, there lived a monkey who resided on a mango tree, 
which was on the banks of the river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile
and his wife.
One day the crocodile came and took rest under the same mango tree. The kind hearted
moneky offered mangoes to the crocodile. Crocodile enjoys the fruits and back for more
next day.
This is third change.
